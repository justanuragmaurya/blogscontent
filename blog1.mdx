# What is Docker
Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, portable units that package an application and all of its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files, allowing it to run consistently across different environments, from development to production.

### Key Concepts of Docker:

1. **Containers**: These are the building blocks of Docker. They isolate applications in a standardized environment, ensuring that they run the same way regardless of where they are deployed. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host machine's OS kernel and are more lightweight.

2. **Images**: Docker containers are created from Docker images, which are pre-configured templates that include everything needed to run the application. These images can be versioned and shared across teams or the public using platforms like Docker Hub.

3. **Dockerfile**: A script that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the base image, the commands to install dependencies, and configuration settings for running the application.

4. **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based repository where Docker users can share container images. You can pull pre-built images or push your own images to the Hub.

5. **Docker Compose**: A tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It uses a `docker-compose.yml` file to configure the services, networks, and volumes in your application stack.

### Benefits of Docker:
- **Portability**: Docker containers can run on any platform that supports Docker (e.g., Linux, Windows, macOS), ensuring consistent performance across environments.
- **Efficiency**: Containers are lightweight and require fewer resources than traditional virtual machines because they share the host's operating system kernel.
- **Scalability**: Docker makes it easy to scale applications by allowing more containers to be spun up or down as needed.
- **Isolation**: Each container runs independently with its own processes and network, making applications more secure and reliable.

# What is Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text file containing a set of instructions used to build a Docker image. It defines everything needed to configure the environment in which an application runs, such as the base image, application source code, dependencies, environment variables, and commands to be executed.

Below is a basic dockerfile that allows us to build an image of any nodejs application

```bash
# Base image
FROM node:16

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the application code
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the default command to run your app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
### So what does every line mean ? 

1. **`FROM`**: This specifies the base image from which the Docker image will be built. It is often an existing official image like a Linux distribution or a language runtime (e.g., `node`, `python`).
   ```bash
   FROM node:16
   ```

2. **`COPY`** or **`ADD`**: These commands copy files from your local file system to the Docker image.
   ```bash
   COPY . /app
   ```

3. **`WORKDIR`**: Sets the working directory inside the container. All subsequent commands (e.g., `RUN`, `COPY`) will be executed relative to this path.
   ```bash
   WORKDIR /app
   ```

4. **`RUN`**: Executes a command inside the image. It is typically used to install dependencies or set up the environment.
   ```bash
   RUN npm install
   ```

5. **`EXPOSE`**: Informs Docker which port the container will listen on. This is more of a documentation feature, as it does not actually publish the port; you'd need to do that using `docker run -p`.
   ```bash
   EXPOSE 3000
   ```

6. **`ENV`**: Sets environment variables that will be available to the running container.
   ```bash
   ENV NODE_ENV=production
   ```

7. **`CMD`**: Specifies the default command to run when the container starts. If this is overridden at runtime 
   ```bash
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```
# Dockerizing a nextjs app 
Now that we’re familiar with Docker and Dockerfile, let's create a Docker image for a Next.js application. Below is the Dockerfile we’ll be using for this process.
```bash
FROM node:20

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN npm i

RUN npx prisma generate

RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000http://localhost:3000/blog/vps-setup

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```
After the image is built, we can use 
```bash
docker run -t 
```
# Running a docker image 

Running a Docker image involves taking an image (which is essentially a blueprint) and creating a container from it. The container is the running instance of the image. Let’s go through the steps in detail, from building an image to running a container, including explanations of each concept and command.

### Steps to Run a Docker Image

1. **Build the Docker Image** (if not already built):
   Before running a container, you need to have an image. If you don’t already have one, you can create it using a Dockerfile.

   - **Building a Docker Image from a Dockerfile**:
     You can use the `docker build` command to create an image from your Dockerfile.

     ```bash
     docker build -t my-nextjs-app .
     ```

     **Explanation**:
     - `docker build`: This command tells Docker to build an image.
     - `-t my-nextjs-app`: The `-t` flag allows you to name the image (in this case, `my-nextjs-app`).
     - `.`: The dot indicates the location of the Dockerfile (in this case, the current directory).

     After running this command, Docker will follow the instructions in the Dockerfile to create an image.

2. **List Available Docker Images**:
   After building, you can check the list of images you’ve created or downloaded using the `docker images` command.

   ```bash
   docker images
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   This command will show you:
   - `REPOSITORY`: The name of the image (e.g., `my-nextjs-app`).
   - `TAG`: The version tag (e.g., `latest` by default).
   - `IMAGE ID`: A unique identifier for the image.
   - `CREATED`: How long ago the image was created.
   - `SIZE`: The size of the image.

3. **Run a Docker Container**:
   To run a Docker container from an image, you’ll use the `docker run` command.

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 my-nextjs-app
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `docker run`: This command starts a new container from an image.
   - `-p 3000:3000`: This maps port 3000 on your local machine (the first `3000`) to port 3000 inside the container (the second `3000`). It allows you to access the application running in the container from your browser.
   - `my-nextjs-app`: This is the name of the Docker image you want to run.
   
   After this, Docker will:
   - Download any dependencies needed to run the container (if not already available).
   - Start the application inside the container.
   - Map the internal port to your machine’s port.
   - The application will now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Running in Detached Mode**:
   By default, when you run a container, it will run in the foreground, showing logs and output. If you want it to run in the background (detached mode), you can use the `-d` flag.

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-nextjs-app
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - `-d`: Detached mode, meaning the container runs in the background, allowing you to use the terminal for other commands.

   Once the container is running in detached mode, you can check its status using the following command.

5. **List Running Containers**:
   To see which containers are running, you can use the `docker ps` command.

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   This command will show you:
   - `CONTAINER ID`: The unique identifier for the running container.
   - `IMAGE`: The image used to create the container (e.g., `my-nextjs-app`).
   - `COMMAND`: The command being run inside the container.
   - `STATUS`: The current state (e.g., `Up 5 minutes`).
   - `PORTS`: Which ports are being forwarded to your local machine.
   - `NAMES`: The container’s auto-generated name (unless you specify one).

6. **Stopping a Running Container**:
   To stop a container, you’ll need its `CONTAINER ID` or name from `docker ps`.

   ```bash
   docker stop <container_id>
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   This command stops the running container gracefully. Replace `<container_id>` with the actual ID or name of the container.

7. **Removing a Container**:
   If you no longer need the container, you can remove it using the `docker rm` command.

   ```bash
   docker rm <container_id>
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   This removes the stopped container. You can’t remove a running container, so make sure to stop it first using `docker stop`.

8. **Viewing Container Logs**:
   To see the logs (output) of a running or stopped container, use the `docker logs` command.

   ```bash
   docker logs <container_id>
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   This command shows all the logs of the container, which are useful for debugging and checking application output.
# Minimizing docker images 

After executing the build command with the provided Dockerfile, the resulting image size ended up being 2.4GB, which is quite large and not ideal.

## Strategies to Reduce Docker Image Size:
1. **Use a Smaller Base Image**: The base image (node:20-alpine) in your current Dockerfile is already a lightweight version of Node.js, but let’s double-check that we are using the most minimal version.           Alpine is a great start because it’s only a few MBs.
   ```bash
      FROM node:20-alpine
      
      WORKDIR /app
      
      COPY . .
      
      RUN npm i
      
      RUN npx prisma generate
      
      RUN npm run build
      
      EXPOSE 3000
      
      CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
   ```

   Just after using a smaller base image our docker image size dropped too 1.17GB

2. **Multistage Builds**: Docker allows you to use multiple phases in the Dockerfile to optimize the build process and reduce the final image size. By defining separate stages, such as one for installing dependencies, another for building the application, and a final stage for running it, you can ensure that only the essential files and dependencies are included in the final image. This approach avoids bloating the production image with build tools and unnecessary files, improving efficiency and performance. Each stage can selectively copy artifacts from previous stages, making the final image lean and more suitable for deployment.

      Here's the dockerfile that uses multistage build:
   ```bash
   FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
   
   WORKDIR /app
   
   COPY package*.json ./
   
   RUN npm i
   
   FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
   
   WORKDIR /app
   
   COPY . .
   
   COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
   
   RUN npx prisma generate
   
   RUN npm run build
   
   FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
   
   WORKDIR /app
   
   COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
   COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static
   COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./
   
   EXPOSE 3000
   ENV PORT 3000
   
   CMD ["node", "server.js"]
   ```
      
      Let’s break down each stage of this Dockerfile:
      
      ---
      
      ### Stage 1: `deps`
      ```bash
      FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
      
      WORKDIR /app
      
      COPY package*.json ./
      
      RUN npm i
      ```
      
      **Explanation**:
      - **`FROM node:20-alpine AS deps`**: The `deps` stage uses the `node:20-alpine` image (a lightweight version of Node.js 20 based on the Alpine Linux distribution). This is labeled `deps` so we can reference this stage later in the build.
      - **`WORKDIR /app`**: Sets the working directory to `/app`. All subsequent commands will be executed in this directory.
      - **`COPY package*.json ./`**: Copies the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (if available) to the `/app` directory in the container. This is done before copying the entire project to reduce cache invalidation (since dependencies rarely change compared to application code).
      - **`RUN npm i`**: Runs `npm install` to install dependencies defined in `package.json`. These dependencies are installed in the `/app/node_modules` folder. This stage focuses only on dependency installation.
      
      ---
      
      ### Stage 2: `builder`
      ```bash
      FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
      
      WORKDIR /app
      
      COPY . .
      
      COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
      
      RUN npx prisma generate
      
      RUN npm run build
      ```
      
      **Explanation**:
      - **`FROM node:20-alpine AS builder`**: This stage is named `builder`. It again uses the same lightweight Node.js 20 Alpine image, but it's dedicated to building the application.
      - **`WORKDIR /app`**: The working directory is set to `/app`, similar to the previous stage.
      - **`COPY . .`**: Copies all the application files from the local machine to the container’s `/app` directory. This includes your source code, Prisma schema, and other project files.
      - **`COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules`**: This command copies the `node_modules` folder from the `deps` stage into the current `/app/node_modules` folder. This ensures that we use the same installed dependencies during the build process without reinstalling them.
      - **`RUN npx prisma generate`**: This command runs Prisma's code generation step, creating client code for database access based on the Prisma schema.
      - **`RUN npm run build`**: This runs the Next.js build process, which compiles your application into a production-ready build. This will create an optimized `.next` folder.
      
      ---
      
      ### Stage 3: `runner`
      ```bash
      FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
      
      WORKDIR /app
      
      COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
      COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static
      COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./
      
      EXPOSE 3000
      ENV PORT 3000
      
      CMD ["node", "server.js"]
      ```
      
      **Explanation**:
      - **`FROM node:20-alpine AS runner`**: The final stage, called `runner`, also uses the same Alpine-based Node.js 20 image. This stage is for running the production version of the application and should contain only the files necessary to execute the app.
      - **`WORKDIR /app`**: Again, the working directory is set to `/app` inside the container.
      - **`COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./`**: Copies the compiled standalone output from the `builder` stage to the `runner` stage. The `.next/standalone` folder contains all the necessary files (including `server.js`) for running the Next.js app in production mode.
      - **`COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static`**: Copies the static assets from the `builder` stage into the production environment. The static assets include optimized images, CSS, and other client-side resources.
      - **`COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./`**: Copies the `package.json` file from the `builder` stage to the `runner` stage. This allows for dependency management in production.
        
      - **`EXPOSE 3000`**: Informs Docker that the container will listen on port 3000, which can be published to the host system. This does not actually expose the port; it is more for documentation purposes.
        
      - **`ENV PORT 3000`**: Sets the `PORT` environment variable to 3000. This variable can be referenced in your application’s code (e.g., in your Next.js server) to ensure it runs on the correct port.
        
      - **`CMD ["node", "server.js"]`**: The final command specifies what the container should do when it starts. In this case, it runs the Node.js application via `server.js`, which is the entry point of the standalone build generated by Next.js.
      
      ---
      
      ### Why Multistage Builds?
      
      The multi-stage build process helps in **optimizing** the final Docker image in several ways:
      1. **Separate Dependency Installation**: The `deps` stage handles installing dependencies in isolation, making the build cache more efficient (Docker won't need to re-install dependencies unless `package.json` changes).
      2. **Build Separation**: The `builder` stage is focused on compiling and building the application. It includes all the build tools and source files, but they aren't included in the final image.
      3. **Production-Only Files**: The `runner` stage copies only the necessary production files, excluding development dependencies and build tools, resulting in a smaller, more efficient Docker image for deployment.
      
      **To further** optimize your Next.js application for deployment with Docker, it's recommended to enable **standalone mode** in your `next.config.js` file. This can be done by adding the following configuration:
      
      ```js
      // next.config.js
      module.exports = {
        output: 'standalone',
      };
      ```
      
      ### Why Use Standalone Mode?
      
      Next.js' standalone mode bundles all the necessary files (including the Next.js server, dependencies, and application code) into a self-contained folder inside the `.next` directory. This means that in the final production image, only the output from this folder needs to be included, greatly reducing the size of the Docker image. Standalone mode ensures that the compiled app and its dependencies are isolated, eliminating the need to include unnecessary development tools or the full project source code in the production image. This results in a more lightweight, efficient image that is faster to build, deploy, and run in a containerized environment.

# Conclusion 
In conclusion, leveraging a **multi-stage Docker build** combined with **smaller base images** is an effective strategy for optimizing your containerized applications. By separating the build process into distinct stages, you can significantly reduce the size of your Docker image by including only the necessary runtime files and dependencies. This approach not only minimizes bloat but also improves build performance, deployment speed, and overall efficiency in production environments. This streamlined workflow makes it easier to manage, maintain, and deploy your Next.js applications in a more resource-efficient manner.
